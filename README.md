# wireless-HFL
## Description
Welcome to the repository of my *__Final Year Project__* for the M.Eng Electronic and Information Engineering at Imperial College London.<br>
The topic is __Wireless Federated Learning__, and I have studied the impact of client mobility and non-IID data distributions on the learning process of a hierarchical federated learning system.

For more information about the project, the code, and the results, please refer to the [Project Report](https://github.com/alexander3605/wireless-HFL/blob/master/Documentation/FYP_FinalReport_AlessandroSERENA_as6316.pdf).

## User guide
For more information about how to use the HFL simulator, the testbench, and the results visualizer, please refer to pages 83-86 of the [Project Report](https://github.com/alexander3605/wireless-HFL/blob/master/Documentation/FYP_FinalReport_AlessandroSERENA_as6316.pdf).
